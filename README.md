# Nine-Men-Morris MiniMax

Welcome to our school project! Play Nine-Men-Morris against our GOFAI.

## How To Start

### Play From Scratch

**1** You will need MATLAB 2020 to run the .m file.

**2** Be sure to add all file paths to MATLAB 2020 by going to Home/Set Path/Add with subfolders.

**3** Open the file "muehleController5.m" under "Controllers" and run it inside MATLAB 2020.

### Play Userdefined Board

**4** "muehleController5" can be run via the commandline in MATLAB with the following arguments:
```
muehleController5(board, startingPlayer, phase, stonesBeginningPhase)
```

* board:                    Nine-Men-Morris board (3x3x3 matrix) with numbers 1: player, -1: AI and 0: empty
* startingPlayer:           Player to start the game
* phase(1):                 Phase of Player 1
